* Placing conditions on when things happen
* Repeating a certain event
* Just doing it
* Navigating between screens

\(a\) **Conditional with one choice if true** `Tests a given condition. If the condition is true, performs the actions in a given sequence of blocks; otherwise, the blocks are ignored`

\(b\) **Conditional with one choice if true, second choice if false **`Tests a given condition. If the result is true, performs the actions in the -do sequence of blocks; otherwise, performs the actions in the -else sequence of blocks`

\(c\) **Conditional with one choice if true, second choice if another choice is true, otherwise a third choice if false**`Tests a given condition. If the result is true, performs the actions in the -do sequence of blocks; otherwise tests the statement in the -else if section. If the result is true, performs the actions in the -do sequence of blocks; otherwise, performs the actions in the -else sequence of blocks`

#### Repeating a certain event

\(a\) Repeats event **nditional with one choice if **`Runs the blocks in the do section for each item in the list. Use the given variable name, item, to refer to the current list item. You can change the name item to something else if you wish`

\(b\) `Runs the blocks in the do section for each numeric value in the range starting at from and ending at to, incrementing number by the value of by each time. Use the given variable name, number to refer to the current value. You can change the name number to something else if you wish`

\(c\) `Tests the -test condition. If true, performs the action given in -do , then tests again. When test is false, the block ends and the action given in -do is no longer performed`
