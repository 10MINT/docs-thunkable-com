#  Math

---

Math blocks have a wide array  of functions from basic numbers and conditional tests to a variety of math operators and formatters. Math blocks are also useful for introducing randomness into your app

#### Basic number

`Can be used as any positive or negative number (decimals included). Double clicking on the "0" in the block will allow you to change the number`

\(b\) `Tests whether two numbers are not equal and returns true or false`

\(c\) `Tests whether the first number is greater than the second number and returns true or false`

\(d\) `Tests whether the first number is greater than or equal to the second number and returns true or false`

\(e\) `Tests whether the first number is less than the second number and returns true or false`

\(f\) `Tests whether the first number is less than or equal to the second number and returns true or false`
