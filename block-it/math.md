---

Math blocks have a wide array  of functions from basic numbers and conditional tests to a variety of math operators and formatters. Math blocks are also useful for introducing randomness into your app

---

#### Basic number

![](/assets/math-block-1.png)

`Can be used as any positive or negative number (decimals included). Double clicking on the "0" in the block will allow you to change the number`

---

#### Conditional tests

\(a\) ![](/assets/math-block-3.png) \(b\) ![](/assets/math-block-4.png) \(c\) ![](/assets/math-block-5.png)\(d\) ![](/assets/math-block-6) \(e\) ![](/assets/math-block-7.png) \(f\) ![](/assets/math-block-8.png)\(a\) **Equals** `Tests whether two numbers are equal and returns true or false`

\(b\) **Does not equal** `Tests whether two numbers are not equal and returns true or false`

\(c\) **Greater than **`Tests whether the first number is greater than the second number and returns true or false`

\(d\) **Greater than or equal** `Tests whether the first number is greater than or equal to the second number and returns true or false`

\(e\) **Less than** `Tests whether the first number is less than the second number and returns true or false`

\(f\) **Less than or equal **`Tests whether the first number is less than or equal to the second number and returns true or false`

#### Math operators

\(a\) ![](/assets/math-block-10.png) \(b\) ![](/assets/math-block-11.png) \(c\) ![](/assets/math-block-12.png) \(d\) ![](/assets/math-block-13.png) \(e\)![](/assets/math-block-24.png) \(f\)![](/assets/math-block-14.png)\(g\) ![](/assets/math-block-22.png)\(h\) ![](/assets/math-block-23.png)\(i\) ![](/assets/math-block-19.png)\(j\) ![](/assets/math-block-20.png)\(k\) ![](/assets/math-block-21.png)\(l\) 

\(a\) **Addition** `Returns the result of adding any amount of blocks that have a number value together. Blocks with a number value include the basic number block, length of list or text, variables with a number value, etc`

\(b\) **Subtraction** `Returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first`

\(c\)** Multiplication **`Returns the result of multiplying any amount of blocks that have a number value together`

\(d\)** Division **`Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second`

\(e\) **Exponent **`Returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second`

#### Reformatting numbers



#### Randomness

\(a\) ![](/assets/math-block-15.png)\(b\) ![](/assets/math-block-16.png)\(c\) ![](/assets/math-block-17.png)

\(a\) `Returns a random integer value between the given values, inclusive. The order of the arguments doesn't matter`

\(b\) `Returns a random value between 0 and 1`

\(c\) `Use this block to generate repeatable sequences of random numbers. You can generate the same sequence of random numbers by first calling random set seed with the same value. This is useful for testing programs that involve random values`
