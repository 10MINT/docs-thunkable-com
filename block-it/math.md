---

Math blocks have a wide array  of functions from basic numbers and conditional tests to a variety of math operators and formatters. Math blocks are also useful for introducing randomness into your app

---

#### Basic number

![](/assets/math-block-1.png)

`Can be used as any positive or negative number (decimals included). Double clicking on the "0" in the block will allow you to change the number`

---

#### Conditional tests

![](/assets/math-block-2.png)

\(a\) ![](/assets/math-block-3.png) \(b\) ![](/assets/math-block-4.png) \(c\) ![](/assets/math-block-5.png)\(d\) ![](/assets/math-block-6) \(e\) ![](/assets/math-block-7.png) \(f\) ![](/assets/math-block-8.png)\(g\) ![](/assets/math-block-29.png)

\(a\) **Equals** `Tests whether two numbers are equal and returns true or false`

\(b\) **Does not equal** `Tests whether two numbers are not equal and returns true or false`

\(c\) **Greater than **`Tests whether the first number is greater than the second number and returns true or false`

\(d\) **Greater than or equal** `Tests whether the first number is greater than or equal to the second number and returns true or false`

\(e\) **Less than** `Tests whether the first number is less than the second number and returns true or false`

\(f\) **Less than or equal **`Tests whether the first number is less than or equal to the second number and returns true or false`

\(g\) **Is a number? **`Returns true if the given object is a number, and false otherwise`

#### Math operators

\(a\) ![](/assets/math-block-10.png) \(b\) ![](/assets/math-block-11.png) \(c\) ![](/assets/math-block-12.png) \(d\) ![](/assets/math-block-13.png) \(e\)![](/assets/math-block-24.png) 

\(a\) **Addition** `Returns the result of adding any amount of blocks that have a number value together. Blocks with a number value include the basic number block, length of list or text, variables with a number value, etc`

\(b\) **Subtraction** `Returns the result of subtracting the second number from the first`

\(c\)** Multiplication **`Returns the result of multiplying any amount of blocks that have a number value together`

\(d\)** Division **`Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second`

\(e\) **Division with no remainder** `Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second and discarding any fractional part of the result`

\(f\)![](/assets/math-block-14.png)\(g\) ![](/assets/math-block-22.png)\(h\) ![](/assets/math-block-23.png)\(i\) ![](/assets/math-block-19.png)\(j\) ![](/assets/math-block-20.png)\(k\) ![](/assets/math-block-21.png)

\(f\) **Exponent **`Returns the result of the first number raised to the power of the second`

\(g\) **Natural log** `Returns the natural logarithm of a given number, that is, the logarithm to the base e (2.71828...)`

\(h\)** e^ **`Returns e (2.71828...) raised to the power of the given number`

\(i\) **Square root** `Returns the square root of the given number`

\(j\) **Absolute value** `Returns the absolute value of the given number`

\(k\) **Negative** `Returns the negative of a given number`

\(l\) ![](/assets/math-block-18.png)\(m\) ![](/assets/math-block-25.png)\(n\) ![](/assets/math-block-26.png)\(o\) ![](/assets/math-block-27.png)\(p\) ![](/assets/math-block-28png)



\(l\) **Max** `Returns the largest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, max will also consider 0 in its set of numbers`

\(m\) **Min** `Returns the smallest value of a set of numbers. If there are unplugged sockets in the block, min will also consider 0 in its set of numbers`

\(n\) **Round** `Returns the given number rounded to the closest integer. If the fractional part is <.5 it will be rounded down. It it is >.5 it will be rounded up. If it is exactly equal to .5, numbers with an even whole part will be rounded down, and numbers with an odd whole part will be rounded up`

\(o\) **Ceiling** `Returns the smallest integer that's greater than or equal to the given number`

\(p\) **Floor** `Returns the greatest integer that's less than or equal to the given number`

\(q\)

#### Randomness

\(a\) ![](/assets/math-block-15.png)\(b\) ![](/assets/math-block-16.png)\(c\) ![](/assets/math-block-17.png)

\(a\) `Returns a random integer value between the given values, inclusive. The order of the arguments doesn't matter`

\(b\) `Returns a random value between 0 and 1`

\(c\) `Use this block to generate repeatable sequences of random numbers. You can generate the same sequence of random numbers by first calling random set seed with the same value. This is useful for testing programs that involve random values`
