| Start with a sample app. Understanding what is possible in an app and what others have done will save you a lot of time | Add your favorite technologies and write the story of how you'd like them to work together with blocks | See changes while you build in real time. Even hard core developers don't have this superpower. Requires downloading the Thunkable Live app | Download your app to your phone in minutes and show it off to the world -- or at least the people you meet | For apps that you want to reach greater audiences, follow the steps to publish, promote and maintain them on the App Store. $99 / year required | Share your app projects with collaborators, friends or the larger Thunkable community |
