#### Opening up a new app with a universal link

A user can open an app installed on their phone by clicking a universal link, an iOS standard that can not only open an app but also open it to a specific page. You can check if a universal link is available \(not all apps support universal links\) for a particular app by checking a given url with the [App Search API Validation tool](https://search.developer.apple.com/appsearch-validation-tool) from Apple
