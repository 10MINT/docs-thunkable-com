#### **Thunkable for iOS **

# Step 3 `Test Live`

---

One of Thunkable's coolest features is the ability to change and update your app in real-time. Not even hard-core developers have this super power. Once you have synced your app with your project, every change you make to your project will be reflected in your app

* [Install Thunkable's Live Testing app](#1--install-thunkables-live-testing-app) \(first time only\)
* [Sync your app with your project](#2--sync-your-app-with-your-project)
* [See your changes live in your app](#3--see-your-changes-reflected-live-in-your-app)

IMPORTANT: Your computer and app no longer have to be on the same Wi-Fi on iOS, which is a requirement for Thunkable for Android
