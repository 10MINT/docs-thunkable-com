Publishing your app to the App Store can be a lengthy and expensive process.  Apple holds a high standard for apps that are approved for distribution in the App Store so please review Apple's policies and guidelines to make sure your app is in compliance before you sign up for the Apple Developer Program.

To get started publishing your app to the App Store:

* [Enroll in the Apple Developer Program](#1--enroll-in-the-apple-developer-program-currently-99year) \(currently $99 / year\)
* [Register an App ID](#2--register-an-app-id-from-apple-similar-to-package-name-in-android-you-should-be-given-a-team-id) from Apple \(similar to package name in Android\)

### Troubleshooting

**Certificates**

If you have an existing Apple Developer Program account with 2 iOS certificates, you'll have to revoke one. Apple only allows developers to have 2 iOS certificates at a time and Thunkable creates one when it publishes to your account.

**Provisioning Profile**

After you revoke your certificate, it is possible that one or more of your provisioning profiles will become inactive.  To publish successfully, you'll also need to delete any inactive provisioning profiles. 

**Two-factor authentication**

You must turn off 2 factor authentication for your Apple Developer ID to publish with Thunkable
