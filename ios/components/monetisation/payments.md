# Payment powered by Stripe

Accepting payments are a critical part of many apps from on-demand services to in-person commerce. Stripe is one of the most popular payment providers for internet providers globally and powers the Payments component, which accepts all major debit and credit cards from customers in every country in [135+ currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).

`Publishable Key`

`Stripe Account ID`

#### \(Optional\) Step ④ / Require full address \(iOS only\)

On iOS, there is an option to require a full address instead of just a zip code when accepting payment. Stripe reserves the right to change the payout schedule or suspend payments to your bank account if they deem it necessary, likely if there is fraudulent activity in the payments. Requiring a full address lowers the risk of fraudulent activity.
