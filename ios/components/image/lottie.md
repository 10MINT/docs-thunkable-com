[Lottie Animation](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) renders After Effects animations in real time, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use static images.

There is a large community of designers who have [created free and editable animations](https://www.lottiefiles.com/community) in After Effects that you can easily add to your app.

Big thanks to the team at Airbnb for doing much of the work to enable what has become a very popular way to jazz up an app.
