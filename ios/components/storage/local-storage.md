# Local Storage \(aka Tiny DB\)

---

Local Storage is a storage component that saves small amounts of data directly to your phone. It does not require an internet connection to store and retrieve data and is often used to save data from a previous session e.g. remember your login information

Local Storage is an invisible component which means there are no visible elements of the component and that it is available for use across all Screens in the app
