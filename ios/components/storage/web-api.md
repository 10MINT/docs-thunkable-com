The Web API component provides functions for HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests used mainly to retrieve data from an open Web API service like Yahoo Finance for stock quotes or Weather Underground for weather information.

APIs unfortunately usually speak the language of code and not of humans so it is helpful to format these requests using our new [Object](/ios/blocks/objects.md) blocks.
