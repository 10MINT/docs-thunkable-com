Realtime DB powered by Firebase is cloud storage component that stores and retrieves `keys` and their corresponding `values` in a database that can be accessed in real-time \(super fast\). 

This version of the component supports storing app data in unique project buckets associated with a user's project. A future version will include the option for users to save their data to their own unique Firebase instance.
