The Assistant component powered by Dialogflow, an Alphabet company, enables real-time voice responses to user questions asked by voice. The Assistant understands a user's natural language and the developer simply programs the questions and responses to return to the user. This can be helpful in a variety of general voice enabled apps like Siri to be leveraged in more specific domains like education
