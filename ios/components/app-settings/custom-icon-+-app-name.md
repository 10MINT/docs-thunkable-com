# Custom Icon + App Name

---

Thunkable for iOS supports uploading a separate image file for your custom icon and adding your app name -- the name that appears next to your app icon on your phone \(this is different from your project name when you create a new app\).  

For the app icon, please make sure the file you upload is not the same as one that you [uploading in your assets folder](/ios/components/app-settings/upload-media.md). This will cause an error.
