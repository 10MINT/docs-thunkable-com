# Spreadsheets powered by Airtable

---

The backbone to many apps is data and managing your app data in a Spreadsheet can be very user friendly. The Spreadsheet component is powered by Airtable, a radically different and Ashton Kutcher's favorite way of organizing anything from film projects to apartment hunts and customer lists.

Airtable looks like a spreadsheet but actually acts like a database so it can store attachments i.e. images in your spreadsheets \(and not just text\) and easily link records between spreadsheets
