Realtime DB powered by Firebase is cloud storage component that stores and retrieves `keys` and their corresponding `values` in a database that can be accessed in real-time \(super fast\).

This version of the component supports storing app data in unique project buckets associated with a user's project. You can add your own private database instance by following the instructions below.
