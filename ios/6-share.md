### 1 / When you are ready to share your app project, generate a link to a copy of your app project \(including assets and other contents\). IMPORTANT: Make sure that there is no information including passwords, API keys or proprietary app assets that you want to share with your app![](/assets/share-ios-fig-1.png)![](/assets/share-ios-fig-2.png)When you select 'Generate', we will make a copy of your app project at the current moment in time

###  2 / We recommend tracking how many times your project is copied with a link tracking service like [Bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) or [Google URL shortener](https://goo.gl/)

---

### 3 / Copy and share your link with your collaborators, the wider Thunkable community or maybe even your mom! 

### Users who click the link will need to be logged in first to receive a copy of your app project. If you make changes to your app project, you will have to generate a new link if you want users to receive your latest version
