### Share your app project by link

#### **Step **① / Remove all API keys / passwords / other files you don't want to share

When you share your project, we automatically clear out any app settings which currently includes Firebase and Stripe keys and urls

#### **Step **② / Generate a share link

When you generate a share link, it will create a copy of your app project at the point in time you generate the link. If you update your app and want your collaborators / remixers to have the latest copy, you'll have to generate a new link

#### **Step **③ / Share and track your links

When a user clicks on your share link, a copy of your app will automatically appear in their account. For every copy of your app that is created in a user's account, you will get credit for a share on your project page
