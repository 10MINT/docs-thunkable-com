### If you have apps published on the Google Play Store made from both the Thunkable for Android platform AND from Beta {#migrate-both}

WARNING: You can only have one unique keystore per account. If you import your keystore from Beta to the main Thunkable for Android platform, it will override that keystore.  We highly recommend that you first download your keystore from both platforms and save it in a safe place.  When you are ready to publish an app that was made on Thunkable beta, then upload the beta keystore.  When you want to publish an app made on the Thunkable for Android main platform, then upload that corresponding keystore.

### Step 1. Export your keystore from Thunkable for Android \(app.thunkable.com\). Save it in a safe place.

* Sign into [Thunkable for Android](https://app.thunkable.com)
