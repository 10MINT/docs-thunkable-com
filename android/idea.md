#### **Thunkable for Android **‚ù§

# Step 1 `Idea`

### **Start with a problem you want to solve**

The most successful apps solve real problems. These problems can range from problems that only you face---to problems of a local community you are a part of--to challenges facing businesses and organizations that you love.

Since apps are easy to create on Thunkable, no problem is too small.

Our advice is to start small -- and to start with what you know.  If it works, then you can start expanding from there.
