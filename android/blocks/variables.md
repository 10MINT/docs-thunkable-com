Variables are helpful nicknames for elements in your app that can be a value, text string, list, or color which you want to store so that you can use them at any time in your app \(global variables\) or specified times \(local variables\)

There are two types of variables in apps - global and local. Global variables are available in any procedure or event while local variables can only be used for specific procedures or events.

To create a global variable, just connect this block to any basic math, text, list or color block. Clicking on `name`\_ \_will change the name of this global variable.
