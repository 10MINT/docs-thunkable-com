#### It's been a few months since features have been added -- is Thunkable still working to develop its Android platform? 

Apologies for our delay in adding more features for Android. Much of our engineering team has been focused on our new iOS platform but the new platform holds many future improvements for Android as well.  We are working as hard as we can to bring those to the present sooner -- and in the mean time, have added an engineer on our team to continue adding features to the current Android platform.
