### `Icons & Design Resources`

Generating your own designs for icons, buttons, backgrounds and more can be time-consuming for the non-designer.  Here are some resources that we've found really helpful:

App Icons for launcher icons and buttons

* [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/) packaged as a font so you don't have to import images on your own

* [Android Asset Studio](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/) - designed for native Android developers, a collection of tools for generating device frames for screenshots, launcher icons, generic icons and more

* [Android Material Icon Generator](https://www.gitbook.com/book/thunkable/thunkable-docs/edit#) - generator of app launcher icons

Colors

* [Material Design Palette](https://www.gitbook.com/book/thunkable/thunkable-docs/edit#) - color palette generator for creating color combinations according to the Material specification

### `Switches`

Conditional blocks are very powerful ways of setting the conditions on which certain events occur. There are some cases especially when switching between two events \(e.g. turning on and off a record location button\) where a switch can be very useful
