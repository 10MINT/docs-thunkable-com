# Lego Mindstorms

---

Lego was the inspiration for the blocks that are a core part of the Thunkable app building experience.

Lego Mindstorms are series of kits contain software and hardware to create customizable, programmable robots. They include an intelligent brick computer that controls the system, a set of modular sensors and motors, and [Lego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego) parts from the [Technic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Technic) line to create the mechanical systems. EV3 is the current version of Lego Minstorms and NXT has now been retired.

With Thunkable, you can build an app that controls your Lego Mindstorm robot.

#### Add a Bluetooth Client component to set up your Lego Mindstorm component\(s\)

All of these components have a Bluetooth Client property that tells which Bluetooth Client component to use for communication with the robot. You will need to explicitly add a Bluetooth Client component to your project.

If you have one robot, you should have one BluetoothClient component. If you are lucky enough to have two robots and you want to control both of them simultaneously from one application, you'll need two BluetoothClient components in your project.

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bluetooth Client | The BluetoothClient component that should be used for communication |
