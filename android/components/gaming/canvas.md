If you are developing a gaming or drawing app, you're likely going to start with a Canvas component, a touchable background element that a user can both draw on and interact with moving elements known as Sprites.

The sample app [Inside 2016: Latest Trends in India](https://www.gitbook.com/book/albertching/thunkable-docs/edit#) uses a Canvas a backdrop to an interactive game

* [Style Canvas Background](#style-canvas-background)
* [Draw Dots](#draw-dots)
  * Add a circle with each touch of the canvas
* [Draw Lines](#draw-lines)
  * Draw a line of width 5 on the canvas
* [Draw Text](#draw-text)
  * Add text "developer of the future" angled at 30 degrees with each touch of the canvas
* [Interact with Balls or Image Sprites](#interact-sprites)
  * Move a ball right and down 30 pixels every time it is touched
* [Pinch to Scale Balls or Image Sprites](#pinch-scale) 
  * Scale up or down a ball by pinching on the Canvas

| Events | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Touched \(x, y, touchedSprite\) | When the user touches the canvas and then immediately lifts finger. The \(x,y\) position of the touch is relative to the upper left of the canvas. TouchedSprite is true if the same touch also touched a sprite |
| Flung \(x, y, speed, heading, xvel, yvel, flungSprite\) | When a fling gesture \(quick swipe\) is made on the canvas: provides the \(x,y\) position of the start of the fling, relative to the upper left of the canvas. Also provides the speed \(pixels per millisecond\) and heading \(0-360 degrees\) of the fling, as well as the x velocity and y velocity components of the fling's vector.
