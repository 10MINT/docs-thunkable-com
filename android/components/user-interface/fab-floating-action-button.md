# Floating Action Button \(FAB\) ![](/assets/FAB-icon.png)

Floating Action Buttons are circular Material Design standard buttons that represent the primary action in an app. Unlike regular buttons, FABs float above the other elements on the screen. Material Design FABs can be standard sized \(56 x 56 dp\) or mini \(40 x 40 dp\) and can be customized both in terms of color and the icon on the button.

Note: The Floating Action Button is not yet visible on the Phone Previewer when you add it to your app. It is visible during Live Testing and when you Export your app.

#### Position your FAB

The most common position for FAB is on the bottom right with a padding of 16 or 24 dp from the bottom and right. There is also an alternate use case as specified by Material Design standards. We recommend sticking to these guidelines in most cases since users are familiar with these positions and will more likely engage in the primary action of your app.![](/assets/fab-fig-1.png)

#### Select your icon

For user's convenience, Thunkable has automatically preloaded the Material Icon Font into the FAB and you can select from the entire library the 'Icon Name'. If the name has two words e.g. mic off, you will need to add an underscore e.g. mic\_off.

To see more options, [navigate here to the library](https://material.io/icons/)

#### Add animation to your FAB

Since FABs often represent the primary action in an app, developers will often add animation to transition between FABs depending different events that have been triggered
