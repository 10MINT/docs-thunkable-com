# Push Notifications by One Signal ![](/assets/one-signal-icon.png)

---

Used correctly, push notifications can be a very valuable asset to engage with your app audience.

However, like ads, being overly aggressive can backfire and have a negative effect on your users. We recommend limiting your push notifications to content that will be welcomed by a large majority of your users -- otherwise, you risk users turning you off forever.

| App type | Notification frequency |

| Retail | During seasonal sales \(or near physical sales\) |
