# Push Notifications by One Signal ![](/assets/one-signal-icon.png)

---

User retention in apps is hard and push notifications can be a very valuable asset to continue to engage with your app audience after they have downloaded your app.![](/assets/push-fig-4.png)

However, like ads, being overly aggressive can backfire and have a negative effect on your users. Annoying notifications--those that are irrelevant and too frequent--are the number one reason why users uninstall mobile apps.

| App type | Frequency | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E-commerce | Sales | Coupon code |
| Game | App updates | Try this new level |

We recommend limiting push notifications to content that will be welcomed by a large majority of your users. Less is more!

Most of the work you do to use push notifications in your app will be on the One Signal interface. On Thunkable, you simply drag and drop the component in and add the One Signal API key.

#### Push immediately or schedule the notification
