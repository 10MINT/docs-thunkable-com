Or be inspired by problems that other people have solved with apps | Add your favorite technologies and write the story of how you'd like them to work together with blocks | Download the Thunkable Live companion and test your apps while you build them in real time. Even hard core developers don't have this | Share your app with your friends and your app source code with the larger Thunker community.
