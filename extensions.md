# Extensions

---

Extensions are components that have been created by our amazing community of Thunkers. While Thunkable cannot guarantee that our platform will support all extensions, many of them do work wonderfully on Thunkable and have addressed a variety of developer needs from better Material Design elements to communicating with your Arduino.

With the help of our community, our goal is to incorporate these extensions over time into platform to make it even easier to create your app.

To use an extension in your app,

1. First download an extension \(.aix\) it from a trusted resource like the [Thunkable Community Extension Directory](http://extensiondirectory.com/)
2. Import it to the Extensions drawer of your Designer palette
3. Drag and drop the extension into your app
