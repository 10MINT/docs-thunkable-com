| Benefits | Thunkable ✕ is the new platform where anyone can build apps on Android or iOS without coding. Users create a single project that works on both Android and iOS devices | Build for iOS simultaneously, 5x higher app size limits \(50 MB vs. 10 MB\), custom package names, powerful new design capabilities including [navigators](/ios/components/screen-layout/navigators/README.md), [animation](/ios/components/image/lottie.md) and advanced properties, new components including [Assistant](/ios/components/voice/assistant.md) and [Sign In](/ios/components/screen-layout/authentication/sign-in.md) and new [Object](/ios/blocks/objects.md) blocks for formatting imported data | Build for Android in the same project you are building for iOS |
| Tradeoffs | -- | New interface including new blocks, some components and properties missing \(although will be added quickly\), no extension capabilities \(yet\) | -- |
| Recommendation | Copy a [sample app](/x/faqs/1-sample-apps.md), download the live testing apps below to preview and make changes | Start early to test the limits of the new platform, give us feedback and help us make it work for you!   | If you want to develop for Android, download the live testing app. If not, just continue building as you have and keep an eye on our [release notes](/x/release-notes.md) |

**I am a Thunkable Android user. How will **✕** work for me?  Can I import my projects?**

Thunkable ✕ was built completely redesigned from the ground up to give users a more modern, intuitive  and more efficient way to build apps leveraging the latest technologies.

Unfortunately, that means projects on Thunkable Android are not easily importable to ✕ and we recommend starting all projects from scratch. You will notice that there are also some components that are not yet available on ✕ \(we are working on adding more soon\) and also some that are available only on ✕. You will also notice that some key tasks like live testing, downloading, exporting and sharing projects have also been updated.

**I am a Thunkable iOS user. How will **✕** work for me?  Can I import my projects?**

Thunkable ✕ works similarly to Thunkable iOS \(similar components, workflow etc\) with the added benefit that projects you create for iOS will also work on your Android devices. In fact, your existing iOS projects should simply appear in your Thunkable ✕ account.  No importing necessary.
