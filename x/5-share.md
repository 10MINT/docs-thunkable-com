Sharing is one of the most important features on the Thunkable platform. We make it simple to share your latest app projects with the community, your collaborators or even your mom with a click of a link. After clicking on the link, a copy of your project will be created in your recipient's account.

### Share your app project by link

#### **Step **① / Remove all API keys / passwords / other files you don't want to share

When you share your project, we automatically clear out any app settings which currently includes Firebase and Stripe keys and urls

#### **Step **② / Generate a share link

When you generate a share link, it will create a copy of your app project at the point in time you generate the link. If you update your app and want your collaborators / remixers to have the latest copy, you'll have to generate a new link

#### **Step **③ / Share and track your links

When a user clicks on your share link, a copy of your app will automatically appear in their account. For every copy of your app that is created in a user's account, you will get credit for a share on your project page
