# Blocks

---

On Thunkable, we've lowered the barrier to making your own app by eliminating the need to speak the language of code.  The language of blocks simplifies programming simple and even complex actions in your app but does require some understanding of computational thinking concepts like variables, objects, conditional statements and loops.

Every component has blocks that can be connected to the pre-loaded blocks below:

| Logic | Control | Math |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |
| **Text** | **Lists** | **Colour** |
|  |  |  |
| **Objects** | **Variables** | **Functions** |
|  |  |  |
