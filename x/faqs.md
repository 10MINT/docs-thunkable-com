# Welcome to Thunkable ✕.

Thunkable ✕ is our new platform where anyone can build apps on Android or iOS. Users create a single project that works on both Android and iOS devices.

This platform is currently in beta -- which means users interested in testing the platform, building great apps, giving us feedback & reporting bugs can apply to get early access by [filling out this form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc74rUVWrsXyM431brDa8oRvXw-2Dumcwu1fl99qBEkNH7xgg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Frequently Asked Questions

**I am a Thunkable Android user. How will **✕** work for me?  Can I import my projects?**

Thunkable ✕ was built completely redesigned from the ground up to give users a more modern, intuitive  and more efficient way to build apps leveraging the latest technologies.

Unfortunately, that means projects on Thunkable Android are not easily importable to ✕ and we recommend starting all projects from scratch. You will notice that there are also some components that are not yet available on ✕ \(we are working on adding more soon\) and also some that are available only on ✕. You will also notice that some key tasks like live testing, downloading, exporting and sharing projects have also been updated.

**I am a Thunkable iOS user. How will **✕** work for me?  Can I import my projects?**

Thunkable ✕ works similarly to Thunkable iOS \(similar components, workflow etc\) with the added benefit that projects you create for iOS will also work on your Android devices.
