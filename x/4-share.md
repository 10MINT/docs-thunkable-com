Sharing is one of the most important features on the Thunkable platform. You can share both your app projects and on Android, your apps themselves.  \(iOS does not permit distribution of apps outside of its App Store\).

### Share your app project by link

#### **Step **① / Remove all API keys / passwords / other files you don't want to share

When you share your project, we automatically clear out any app settings which currently includes Firebase and Stripe keys and urls

#### **Step **② / Generate a share link

When you generate a share link, it will create a copy of your app project at the point in time you generate the link. If you update your app and want your collaborators / remixers to have the latest copy, you'll have to generate a new link

#### **Step **③ / Share and track your links

When a user clicks on your share link, a copy of your app will automatically appear in their account. For every copy of your app that is created in a user's account, you will get credit for a share on your project page

#### Important note for your friends

Anyone installing your app directly, instead of from the Play Store, will need to change the setting on their phone to allow installation of non-market applications.

To find this setting on versions of Android prior to 4.0, go to "Settings &gt; Applications" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources". For devices running Android 4.0 or above, go to "Settings &gt; Security" or "Settings &gt; Security & Screen Lock" and then check the box next to "Unknown Sources" and confirm your choice.
