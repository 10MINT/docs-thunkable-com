Thunkable makes it easy to download your app project to your phone. Before you download, we recommend first [adding an App Icon and Name](/x/create/app-icon-name.md) to your app.

Due to special circumstances from Apple, there is a limit of one downloaded app per phone on iOS. Download wait times will also be a bit longer.
