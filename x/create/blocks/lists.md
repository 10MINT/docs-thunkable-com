### Sort list

If you are importing a list from a Spreadsheet or other data source, it may be helpful to sort it in your app. You can sort a list alphabetically or numerically, ascending or descending

### Select from a list

Items in a list have an index number, the first item is 1, second is 2 and so on. Not only can you `select` an item from a list by number from the `front` but also from the `back`, the `first`, the `last` and also a `random` item. You can but  `remove` it after you have selected it
