# An Intro to Spacing

---

Since mobile phones and tablets are made in all different shapes and sizes, it's not possible to simply drag and drop elements on a screen so that they are positioned on a screen like you would in a Google Slides document, which is set to a fixed height and width.

To position elements of an app in Thunkable, you'll have to manage the spacing between elements with a few powerful properties. You will also fins some helpful examples in the [design templates](/x/get started/design-templates.md) and [sample apps](/x/get started/sample-apps.md).

* [Spacing within a Screen, Row or Column](#spacing-within-a-screen-row-or-column)
* [Spacing around Visible Components within a Screen, Row or Column](#spacing-around-visible-components-within-a-screen-row-or-column)

#### Spacing within a Screen, Row or Column

You can space elements within a Screen, Row or Column using two powerful properties `Justification` and `Alignment`.

`Justification` in a Screen and Row; In a column, Justification and Alignment is reversed

#### Spacing around Visible Components within a Screen, Row or Column

To create space around a visible component like an Image, you can use the `margin` and `padding` that are found in the Advanced section of the component properties. In most cases, you can add a margin OR padding to create space around an element -- they are interchangeable and can be set both in pixels and percent of the height or width. The fastest way to see what makes the most sense is to [live test](/x/3-live-test.md) on your phone. ![](/assets/spacing-✕-fig-3.png)
