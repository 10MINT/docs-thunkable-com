# Animation ![](/assets/iOSviewIconLottie.png) powered by Lottie

---

One of the coolest new design elements you can add to your app is animation. The Animation component powered by [Lottie ](https://airbnb.design/lottie/)makes adding animations as easy as adding images. Animations are created in [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) and imported as a `.json` file.

There is a large and growing community of designers who have [created free and editable animations](https://www.lottiefiles.com/community) that you can easily add to your app.

Big thanks to the team at Airbnb for enabling one of the most popular open technologies in apps today!
