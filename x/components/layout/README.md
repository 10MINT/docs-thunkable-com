### Arrange Screens with Navigators

Most modern apps navigate through screens using bottom or top tab menus which enable swiping between screens \([Tab Navigator](/x/components/layout/tab-navigator.md)\), side menus that are invisible until swiped to appear \([Drawer Navigator](/x/components/layout/drawer-navigator.md)\) or stacking a new screen that can be dismissed \(Stack Navigator\).
