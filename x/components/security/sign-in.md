#### Sign Up, Sign In, Sign out, Reset Password

| Event | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Sign up \( `email`, `password)`\) | Signs up a user for a new account. Returns an `error` if sign up is not successful. A common `error` is "The email address is already in use by another account." |
| Sign in \( `email`, `password`\) | Signs in an existing user. Returns an `error` if sign in is not successful, either because the email is not registered or the password is incorrect. You can also use the `isEmailVerified`output to limit user to sign in only if they have verified their email |
| Sign out \( `email`\) | Signs out a user from an account, usually to sign in with a different account |
| Reset password \( `email`\) |  |
