# Realtime Database ![](/assets/iOSviewIconFirebaseDB.png) powered by Firebase

---

Realtime DB powered by Firebase is cloud storage component that stores and retrieves `keys` and their corresponding `values` in a database that can be accessed in real-time \(super fast\).

This version of the component supports storing app data in unique project buckets associated with a user's project. You can add your own private database instance by following the instructions below.

IMPORTANT As a general rule, user data should always be kept secure.  We strongly advise that you use own Firebase account both to ensure the privacy of your user data and to give you visibility into the database itself. We provide our database for your convenience but we may also clean out our shared account periodically.

#### Use Your Own Private Firebase Account \(recommended\) {#private-firebase}

IMPORTANT As a general rule, user data should always be kept secure.  We strongly advise that you use own Firebase account both to ensure the privacy of your user data and to give you visibility into the database itself.  Firebase Realtime Database also pairs well with [Sign in](/ios/components/screen-layout/authentication/sign-in.md) and you can use a single Firebase project for both services.

#### Step 1 / Create an account with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for free \(you can upgrade to a paid plan later\)

#### Step 2 / After creating your project, retrieve the API key and database URL for your project from the Firebase console.  One way to retrieve those values is illustrated below.

#### Step 3 / On Thunkable, you can simply copy the API key and database URL into App Settings \(which you can find by clicking on your project app icon on the top left. ![](/assets/firebase-ios-fig-5.png)

#### Step 4 / If you are using Firebase with a [Sign In](/ios/components/screen-layout/authentication/sign-in.md), you can leave the database rules as they are by default.

#### If you do not want to require users to sign in, you'll need to change your database rules to accept users to save to your database.
