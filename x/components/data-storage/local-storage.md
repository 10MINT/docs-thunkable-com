Local Storage is a storage component that saves data directly to a user's phone. It does not require an internet connection to store and retrieve data and is often used to save data from a previous session e.g. remember your name

* [Get data](#get-data)

### Save data

To save data locally to your phone, simple name a `key` to store a `value` under. If you have a previous `value` in your `key`, saving it will override that `value`
