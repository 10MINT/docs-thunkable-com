### S**tart with a sample app**

The most successful apps solve real problems. These problems can range from problems that only you face---to problems of a local community you are a part of--to challenges facing businesses and organizations that you love.

However, understanding what is possible in an app is not easy especially if you are a first-time developer. We have learned that starting your app journey from an existing app will save you a load of time searching community forums or in coffee shops by yourself.

Below are a few of our favorites with more to come!
