# TextBox and Password TextBox

---

Textboxes are a popular input component especially in apps with forms and login pages.

A password text box is the same as an ordinary TextBox component, except that it displays an encoded character \* instead of the characters typed by the user

|  | TextBox | Password TextBox |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
