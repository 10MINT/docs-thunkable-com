Bluetooth is the communications technology with a funny name[^1]. All smartphones these days have Bluetooth, a very low power short range \(up to 10 meters\) communications link between two compatible devices, most commonly used to pair with wireless headsets, watches and speakers. 

There are two forms of Bluetooth – classic Bluetooth, which is used in this component, and a newer version known as Bluetooth low energy, Bluetooth BLE, Bluetooth LE or Bluetooth Smart – all referring to the same new technology.  The newest Android devices running Android 4.3 or newer, usually support the newest Bluetooth Smart technology.

Setting up a Bluetooth devices involves first “pairing” the two devices and establishing a connection. The Bluetooth Client component sends the connection request and the Bluetooth Server component accepts the request.

[^1]: Bluetooth is actually named for a long ago Danish king who worked to unite groups of people, which is similar to Bluetooth’s goal of interconnecting different devices.  The King’s real name was “Harald” but he had a nickname that translates as “Bluetooth” – no one knows for sure why he had this nickname but one thought is he had one dark tooth that may have appeared black or blue.
