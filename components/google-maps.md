# Google Maps

---

Google Maps is one of the most popular and powerful components on Thunkable.  It enables users to locate themselves, share that location with others in real-time \(in combination with Firebase\) or map geo-located assets \(in combination with Spreadsheets powered by Cloudstitch\).

The map itself can be styled in a million different ways as can the markers that you add to the map.

### Styling the map

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Height | Height in pixels, percent, 'Automatic' or 'Fill' |
| Width | Width in pixels, percent, 'Automatic' or 'Fill' |
| Zoom Level | 1 to 20 where 1 is most zoomed out.  We recommend zoom levels between 13 and 16 |
| Angle \(degrees\) | Tilt of the map from 0 to 90 degrees. We recommend tilts of 45 to 75 degrees and a Zoom Level of 16 for more immersive apps |
| Rotation \(degrees\) | Orientation of the map from 0 to 360 degrees. A rotation of 90 degrees rotates the map 90 degrees counterclockwise. We recommend keeping rotation at 0 except for specific circumstances |
| Shape | Default \(rectangle\), rounded, rectangular or oval.  The shape will not be visible if an Image is being displayed |
| Theme | 'Standard',  |

Rotation \(degrees\)

This specifies the orientation \(bearing\) of the map from 0 to 360 degrees.  A rotation of 90 degrees rotates the map 90 degrees counterclockwise so that east is facing north.   \(Recommended: We generally recommend keeping rotation at 0 degrees to not disorient the user\)

Angle \(degrees\)

This specifies the tilt of the map and accepts values from 0 to 90 degrees.  \(Recommended: For more immersive apps, we recommend angles of 45 to 75 degrees with a zoom level of 16\)

Zoom Level

This specifies the zoom level of the map from 1 to 20 where 1 is the farthest away and the 20 is the most zoomed in. \(Recommended: For most apps, we recommend zoom levels between 13 and 16\)

Theme

To enable map themes, MapType must be set to “normal” \(which is the default\).   Map theme options include “standard”, “silver”, “retro”, “dark”, “night” & “aubergine”.
