# Layout

---

**Layout components allow you to organize your screen into a more readable interface.** Vertical arrangements are often used as a substitute for screens by turning their visibility to 'true' and 'false'.  Horizontal arrangements are often used for arranging content that goes across the screen like a top or bottom menu or for creating padding on a screen \(empty labels can also be used\).  Scrollable arrangements can be useful for apps where there is a lot of content like images that you may not fit within a fixed space.
