# Layout

---

Layout components allow you to organize your screen into a more readable and navigable interface.

Vertical arrangements are often used as a substitute for screens by turning their visibility to 'true' and 'false'.  Horizontal arrangements are often used for arranging content that goes across the screen like a top navigation menu or for creating padding on a screen \(empty labels can also be used\).  Scrollable arrangements can be useful for apps where there is a lot of content like images that you may not fit within a fixed space. Table arrangements are useful when the content should be spaced consistently like in a bottom tabbed menu

The sample app [Thunkableagram: AI-powered Instagram](#) uses all of these types of arrangements

| Component | Vertical Arrangement | Horizontal Arrangement | Vertical or Horizontal Scroll Arrangement | Table Arrangement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Common use case | Screen substitute | Top navigation menu or padding | Scrollable vertical content | Bottom tabbed menu |

#### Pro-tip: Vertical arrangements as Screen substitutes
