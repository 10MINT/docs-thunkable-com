#### **Thunkable for Android **‚ù§

# Components: Screen

---

Screens are natural ways to break up your apps so that they are more digestible to your users. On Thunkable, there is a limit of 10 screens per app.

Screens are where you set layouts and program navigation. Screen1 is also where you set many of your app level properties.

Align Horizontal

A number that encodes how contents of the screen are aligned horizontally. The choices are: 1 = left aligned, 2 = horizontally centered, 3 = right aligned.

Align Vertical
