#### **Thunkable for Android **‚ù§

# Components: Screen

---

Screens are natural ways to break up your apps so that they are more digestible to your users. On Thunkable, there is a limit of 10 screens per app.

Screens are where you set layouts and program navigation. Screen1 is also where you set many of your app level properties.
