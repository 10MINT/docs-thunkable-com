# Microsoft Image and Emotion Recognizer

---

Microsoft's Image and Emotion Recognizer services puts the power of some of the most advanced open artificial intelligence tools in your image-based apps.

The Image Recognizer returns information about visual content found in an image while the Emotion Recognizer detects emotions from images containing a single face.

|  | Image Recognizer | Emotion Recognizer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Recommended images | Any image | Images with a single face |
| Expected result | Single line 'description' with a 'description score' and image 'tags' | Most likely 'emotion' and 'emotion score' from anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise. These emotions are understood to be cross-culturally and universally communicated with particular facial expressions |

The sample app [Thunkableagram: AI-powered Instagram](#) uses the Image Recognizer to auto-caption images

### Microsoft Emotion Recognizer

The Image Recognizer returns information about visual content found in an image and provides a set of tags and its best single line description.

The Emotion API takes a facial expression in an image as an input, and returns the confidence across a set of emotions for each face in the image, as well as bounding box for the face, using the Face API. If a user has already called the Face API, they can submit the face rectangle as an optional input.

The emotions detected are anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise. These emotions are understood to be cross-culturally and universally communicated with particular facial expressions
