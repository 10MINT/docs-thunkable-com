# Microsoft Image and Emotion Recognizer

---

Microsoft's Image and Emotion Recognizer services puts the power of some of the most advanced open artificial intelligence tools in your image-based apps.  

The Image Recognizer returns information about visual content found in an image. 



Use tagging, descriptions, and domain-specific models to identify content and label it with confidence. Apply the adult/racy settings to enable automated restriction of adult content. Identify image types and color schemes in pictures



The Emotion API takes a facial expression in an image as an input, and returns the confidence across a set of emotions for each face in the image, as well as bounding box for the face, using the Face API. If a user has already called the Face API, they can submit the face rectangle as an optional input.

The emotions detected are anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise. These emotions are understood to be cross-culturally and universally communicated with particular facial expressions
