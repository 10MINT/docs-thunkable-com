---

Firebase DB is service that stores a single row of data in the cloud, similar to Tiny Web DB, except that it can be secured by creating your own private database with Firebase.

---

#### Set Up

No set-up is required since Thunkable provides a default account for users to get started quickly.  Once you're app is ready for prime time, we do recommend that you create your own private database for free with Firebase.

To create your own database with Firebase, please [visit this link](https://firebase.google.com/) and follow the steps below.

1. Create a new database by Adding a new project ![](/assets/firebase-fig-1.png)
2. Go to the 'Database' option on the left and copy and paste the Firebase URL to your Thunkable component ![](/assets/firebase-fig-2.png)![](/assets/firebase-fig-3.png)
3. Set the database 'read' and 'write' rules to 'true' ![](/assets/firebase-fig-4.png)

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Firebase URL | Thunkable provides its own url by default so that users can get started quickly.  For apps you intend to share with others, we highly recommend creating you own private database with Firebase and adding in your url |
| Firebase Token | DO NOT CHANGE. This is the token used to authenticate your app. It will be generated by default, so you should not change it |
| Project Bucket | Gets the Project Bucket name for this Firebase DB. This field is given a default name. If you are using the default Firebase database, make sure to change it to something unique so it reduces the chance of conflict with another user |
| Use Default | If checked, uses the default Firebase URL provided by Thunkable |
| Persist | If checked, variables will retain their values when off-line and the App exits. Values will be uploaded to Firebase the next time the App is run while connected to the network. This is useful for applications which will gather data while not connected to the network.  |
