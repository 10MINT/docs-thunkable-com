The Web component provides functions for HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests used mainly to retrieve data from an open Web API service like Yahoo Finance for stock quotes or Weather Underground for weather information. 

We recommend this component for more advanced users since it requires both connecting to the Web API of that service and formatting the data in a useable way for your app, also known as parsing.

#### Web API service settings

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Url | The url for the web request |
| Allow cookies | If true, saves cookies from a response and used in subsequent requests. We recommend setting to true if you want to avoid having to login in each time you send a request |
| Save Response | If true, indicates whether the response should be saved in a file |
| Response File Name | The name of the file where the response should be saved. If Save Response is true and Response File Name is empty, then a new file name will be generated |
| Request | If true, saves cookies from a response and used in subsequent requests. We recommend setting to true if you want to avoid having to login in each time you send a request |
