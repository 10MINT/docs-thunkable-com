# Touch

---

**One of the first defining features of smartphones was the touch screen interface, which enabled developers to utilize all parts of a screen to perform distinct actions, unleashing an almost limitless number of user interface options.**

Below are the different touch interface components and what they look like on a Samsung S6 phone by default

# Button

---

**Buttons are a key input for many apps and one of the most popular components on Thunkable**. Many aspects of its appearance can be changed and different events can be triggered with different types of clicks - regular, long and touch up or touch down.

#### Pro-tip: Buttons and Icon Fonts

One of the most common customizations of buttons is to add an image to them but this can both take time to generate and also take up valuable space in your app.  One way to avoid this is to use one of the many icon fonts available to substitute a custom font for images.

For navigation menus, we highly recommend the [Material Design Icon Font](https://material.io/icons/)

For social media bars, we recommend the [Mono Social Font](http://drinchev.github.io/monosocialiconsfont/)

The sample app [Thunkableagram: AI-powered Instagram](#) uses the Material Design Icon Font for the bottom navigation bar

# Label

---

Labels are components used to display text.  Empty labels are used to provide horizontal and vertical padding between elements.

#### Pro-tip: Labels and HTML formatting

Labels are the only component so far that supports HTML formatting, which can be helpful if you want to add a line break or bold only a few words.

Example:

`<br>Example: Hello World<br><b>How are you?<b/>`
