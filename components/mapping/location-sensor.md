The Location Sensor triangulates between GPS satellites and mobile data networks to estimate a device's location in latitude, longitude. If available, GPS also measures altitude but you likely have to be outside for it to work properly. From the latitude and longitude readings, the location sensor can also provide an estimated street address and the speed at which a device may be moving.![](/assets/location-sensor-fig-1.png)
