---

A 'sprite' is an Image or a Ball that can be placed on a Canvas, where it can react to touches and drags, interact with other sprites  and the edge of the Canvas, and move according to its property values.

The difference between an Image Sprite and a Ball is that an Image Sprite can get its appearance from an image file, while a Ball's appearance can only be changed by varying its PaintColor and Radius properties.
