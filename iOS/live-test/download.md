#### **Thunkable for iOS **

# `Download`

Most iOS developers have to sign up for an [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership \(currently $99/year\) to download an app to their iPhone or iPad.  Thunkable is making it possible to download an iOS app made on Thunkable to your iPhone or iPad without a membership. You will have to trust Thunkable \(or Rappidly Inc, our business name\) to install an app on your device.

Currently, it is possible to download** **_only one Thunkable app on your phone_ at one time
