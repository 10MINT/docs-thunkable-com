### `Getting started`

#### **Are there special requirements to be an iOS developer?** {#any-special-requirements-to-be-an-ios-developer-can-you-make-it-easier-for-new-developers}

iOS app development has its own unique set of requirements that are distinct from Android. Where possible, Thunkable is making easier for new iOS developers to get started on their first app \(compared to hard-core iOS developers\)

* Apple usually requires a MAC device and a free Apple Developer Account to build an iOS app \(.ipa\). Thunkable is enabling users to download an iOS app to their phone without a MAC or an Apple Developer Program account.

* Live testing on Thunkable is possible with either:

  * i\) a MAC + simulator OR

  * ii\) a MAC + iPhone/iPad OR

  * iii\) Windows + iPhone/iPad

* To publish to the App Store, you do have to sign up for the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership \(currently $99/year\)

### `Product`

#### **Does Thunkable build native iOS apps?** {#does-thunkable-build-native-ios-apps}

Unlike other platforms that produce web, HTML5, or hybrid apps, Thunkable iOS apps are fully native and leverage iPhone and iPad capabilities. Just like Thunkable Android apps do with Android.

#### **Is Thunkable for iOS able to make making standalone apps?**

Yes. Unlike other products in the space, Thunkable lets you build standalone apps. Soon, you can download them to your phone and with an Apple Developer Account, publish them to the App Store.

#### **Can I convert my existing Android project into iOS?** {#can-i-convert-my-existing-android-project-into-ios}

Not right now. Some key differences between iOS and Android make one-to-one conversion difficult, if not impossible. We may add a conversion tool to help as much as possible, but for now you should build iOS apps from scratch.
