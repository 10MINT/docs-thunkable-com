# Tiny Web DB

---

Tiny Web DB is a non-visible component that communicates with a Web service to store and retrieve information.

**Important note**: Since the introduction of Firebase, we only recommend the Tiny Web DB component for specific cases where you want to own and manage your own database infrastructure
