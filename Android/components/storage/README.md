# Storage

---

Data is the content that powers most apps and storage is an essential elements of almost every single app that you use. Deciding on which storage option can be complex but the key things to consider are i\) the file types you want to store and retrieve, ii\) the amount of data and iii\) the amount of security you want to have on that data. Since most data for your app should be secured, there is often some set up required to use these components.

At Thunkable, we particularly love data storage options like Firebase that require little set-up to get started but provide the option of security once you have your app working.
