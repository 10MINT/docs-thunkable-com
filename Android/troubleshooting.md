#### **Thunkable for Android **‚ù§

# Troubleshooting

---

### `Building Apps / Apps Crashing`

Common issues

* [Extensions](/Android/extensions.md)

  * Extensions are created by the community and many of them work wonderfully on Thunkable.  A few of them do lead to more frequent app crashes

* Images

  * App icon too large \(we recommend 96 px by 96 px\)
  * Too many / too large images \(the app size limit is 10MB\)
  * Some users have detected that Thunkable works better with .pngs than .jpgs

* Too many screens \(there is not a hard limit on 10 screens but performance reduces beyond that\)

* Blocks
  * Errors in blocks \(usually this will prevent the app from building\)
  * Too many blocks \(we have seen a few cases where a lot of blocks create performance issues\)

### `Backpack`

Common issues

* Emptying the backpack can be completed with a right click on the Blocks Editor![](/assets/empty-backpack.png)

---

### `Tablet`

Common issues

* Cannot see tablet in phone previewer. Need to set Screen Size to 'Responsive' and check to see preview on Tablet size![](/assets/tablet-screen-fig-1.png)

---

### `AdMob` ![](/assets/admob-icon.png)

Common issues

* Ads are not showing up
  * AdMob account created very recently. Usually it takes at least a few hours for the account to be activated
  * For Banner Ads, Screen set to 'Fixed'. Screen needs to be set to 'Responsive'
  * Load Ad block not called in Blocks Editor
  * Account has been suspended by AdMob. Clicking ads on your own app can lead to suspensions as can one or more users repeatedly clicking the ads on your app. Accounts can also be suspended for deceptive ad placement that generates accidental clicks
  * [Check the AdMob forum for more potential errors](https://community.thunkable.com/c/professional/admob)
