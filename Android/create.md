#### **Thunkable for Android **❤

# Step 2 `Create`

---

We designed Thunkable to work for non-developers by eliminating the need to write any code to build a powerful and beautiful native, mobile app. Creating your first app on Android should take only a few steps

If this is your first time on Thunkable, we highly recommend that you [watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ7z3t-98O0)

### 1 / [Login](https://ios.thunkable.com) to Thunkable for Android![](/assets/login-android.png)

### 2 / Create a New Project

1. In Thunkable, click 'Create New App'
2. Enter your Project Name.  If your name has spaces in it, we'll automatically add underscores \(\_\) to fill the spaces. The Project Name is not seen by your users except in your default package name. ![](/assets/create-android-fig-1.png)

### 3 / Rename App \(and Upload App Icon\)

You can change your App Name to be different than your Project Name \(otherwise they will be the same by default\). The App Name is what shows up underneath your app icon on your user's phones

### 4 / **Add App Component\(s\)** {#step-5：-add-app-components}

As you create your app, there are some [app limits](#limits) to be aware of that will hopefully help you avoid problems in the future e.g. crashing, building issues
